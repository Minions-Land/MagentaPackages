# Cell-Cell Communication

**Maturity: REFERENCE** — no compute subcommand; one opinionated recipe below, run in a Python script; emit a `report` dict and `print(report)` to stay grounded. **`liana` 1.8.0 is already in the pinned `task1` env** — no install needed; run the script with the `scrna` interpreter.

## Goal / When to Use

Generate ligand-receptor interaction hypotheses between annotated cell types. Use after you have a **trustworthy annotation** (garbage labels → garbage CCC) and want to explore which types may be signaling to each other.

## Decision Criteria

**The judgment this guides:**

- **Method-consensus vs. single method** — **liana `rank_aggregate`** gives a robust-rank-aggregation (RRA) consensus across multiple methods (CellPhoneDB, NATMI, Connectome, etc.), preferable to any single method for a first pass. Use a single method only when you specifically want its particular score/assumption.

- **Expression-fraction filter** — filter by `expr_prop` (default 0.1) and `min_cells` per group (default 5) so lowly-expressed pairs don't dominate the ranking. A ligand/receptor expressed in <10% of cells in a type is a weak signal.

- **Organism/resource** — pick the ligand-receptor database with `resource_name` (default `'consensus'`). Use `'mouseconsensus'` for mouse; `li.rs.show_resources()` lists all 17 (cellphonedb, cellchatdb, celltalkdb, …).

## Method Menu

- **liana `rank_aggregate`** — robust default; RRA consensus over the single methods below
- **Single methods** (`li.mt.<name>`) when you want one specific score/assumption. `li.mt.show_methods()` lists them: CellPhoneDB, Connectome, log2FC, NATMI, SingleCellSignalR, Geometric Mean, scSeqComm, CellChat
- **Result table** — lands in `adata.uns['liana_res']` as a DataFrame (`key_added` changes the key)

## How-to

```python
import liana as li

# Robust-rank-aggregation consensus
li.mt.rank_aggregate(
    adata,
    groupby='cell_type',
    expr_prop=0.1,             # min fraction of cells expressing L/R in each type
    min_cells=10,              # min cells per type
    use_raw=False,             # our canonical layout: normalized .X, no .raw
    resource_name='consensus', # name of the built-in L-R database
)

# Inspect results
liana_res = adata.uns['liana_res']
print(liana_res.head(20))

# Visualize top interactions (returns a plotnine ggplot — save with .save())
p = li.pl.dotplot(
    adata,
    colour='magnitude_rank',   # consensus magnitude (lower = stronger)
    size='specificity_rank',   # consensus specificity (lower = more specific)
    inverse_size=True,         # so stronger/more-specific pairs render as larger dots
    top_n=20,
    orderby='magnitude_rank',
    orderby_ascending=True,
    figure_size=(8, 6),
)
p.save('liana_top20.png')
# Optionally pass source_labels=[...] / target_labels=[...] (lists of cell types) to subset senders/receivers.
```

**What lands in `adata.uns['liana_res']`** (one row per source×target×L-R pair):
- `source`, `target` — sender, receiver cell types
- `ligand_complex`, `receptor_complex` — the L-R pair
- `magnitude_rank`, `specificity_rank` — RRA consensus ranks (lower = stronger)
- `lr_means`, `expr_prod` — magnitude of the pair
- **Every single method's own score, in the same table**: `cellphone_pvals`, `lrscore`, `scaled_weight`, `spec_weight`, `lr_logfc`. The consensus does not hide them — use them to see *why* a pair ranks high (Honesty, below).

> **`resource_name`, not `resource`.** `resource_name` takes the database *name*; `resource` takes a custom `DataFrame` with `ligand`/`receptor` columns and **overrides** `resource_name`. Passing `resource='consensus'` raises `ValueError: If 'interactions' is None, 'resource' must be a valid DataFrame with columns 'ligand' and 'receptor'`.

## Failure Modes

- **`.raw is not initialized!`** — *symptom:* `ValueError` immediately, before any scoring. *Diagnosis:* liana's `use_raw` defaults to **`True`**, but our canonical layout keeps normalized values in `.X` and raw counts in `layers["counts"]`, with `.raw` unset. *Fix:* pass `use_raw=False` (as above). Do **not** "fix" it by setting `adata.raw` — liana's scores expect normalized, log-transformed expression, which is exactly what `.X` holds.

- **Garbage labels in, garbage CCC out** — *symptom:* implausible sender→receiver pairs (two distant, non-interacting types dominate). *Diagnosis:* CCC is grouped by `cell_type`; wrong/over-clustered annotation corrupts every interaction. *Fix:* fix annotation first (`annotation.md`); never run CCC on `leiden` ids you have not labeled.
- **Top hits are ambient/housekeeping genes** — *symptom:* ribosomal or ubiquitously expressed genes appear as top ligands. *Diagnosis:* ambient contamination or non-specific expression mislabeled as signaling. *Fix:* confirm QC/ambient handling; discard housekeeping pairs; cross-check the ligand is genuinely cell-type-specific.
- **A single pair overwhelms the ranking** — *symptom:* one L-R pair sits far above all others. *Diagnosis:* technical artifact or one contaminant gene. *Fix:* inspect that gene's per-type expression; if it is broadly/ambiently expressed, drop it and re-rank.
- **`expr_prop` mis-set** — *symptom:* hundreds of weak hits, or rare-but-real signals missing. *Diagnosis:* too low (e.g. 0.01) admits noise; too high (e.g. 0.5) censors rare types. *Fix:* keep the 0.1 default unless you have a reason; document any change.

## Figure checkpoints

- **liana dotplot** of top source→target L-R pairs — are the implicated types biologically plausible (e.g. immune → epithelial), or two types that cannot interact? Inspect the plot before any interaction is asserted.

## Grounding

Build the `report` dict **from `liana_res`** (do not hardcode numbers), then `print(report)`:

```python
import liana as li
top = liana_res.sort_values("magnitude_rank").head(20)
report = {
    "method": "liana_rank_aggregate",
    "liana_version": li.__version__,
    "groupby": "cell_type",
    "n_types": int(adata.obs["cell_type"].nunique()),
    "n_interactions": int(len(liana_res)),  # total L-R pairs tested
    "expr_prop": 0.1,
    "min_cells": 10,
    "resource_name": "consensus",
    "top_interactions": top[
        ["source", "target", "ligand_complex", "receptor_complex", "magnitude_rank"]
    ].to_dict("records"),
}
report
```

Ground only the top-ranked interactions (source, target, L-R pair, ranks), the `expr_prop`/`min_cells` used, and the resource — these come straight from `liana_res`. Record the **resource name and liana version**: the L-R databases are curated and change between releases, so "X signals to Y" is a claim about a specific resource version.

## Honesty

- Present CCC as **hypothesis-generating** — expression co-occurrence is **not proof of signaling**. A ligand and receptor being expressed in neighboring types is consistent with communication, but it does not prove it (other mechanisms, autocrine loops, non-functional expression are all possible).

- **Do not over-interpret without orthogonal support** — e.g., if you claim "T cells activate B cells via CD40L-CD40," cite the CCC evidence as supporting, then validate with:
  - Known biology (is this interaction documented?)
  - Spatial co-localization (do these types actually neighbor each other?)
  - Functional perturbation (if you have perturbation data, does blocking the ligand change the target's state?)

- **CCC methods differ** — CellPhoneDB uses a permutation test on mean expression; NATMI uses a weighted score; Connectome uses network topology. The consensus ranking aggregates across these, so it's robust to any one method's assumptions, but it also smooths over real disagreements. If a pair ranks high in the consensus but you want to understand *why*, look at the per-method scores.

- **Spatial CCC (liana bivariate, squidpy ligrec) is stronger** — if you have spatial data, use spatial-aware CCC instead of or in addition to expression-only CCC, because proximity matters (the expression-only consensus here cannot prove physical co-location).
