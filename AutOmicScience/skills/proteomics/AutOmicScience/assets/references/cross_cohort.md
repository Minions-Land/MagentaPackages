# Reference — Cross-Cohort Hypergeometric Enrichment

Testing whether upregulated proteins in cohort A are enriched among upregulated proteins in cohort B — the key test for replication across independent studies.

## The hypergeometric setup

**Question:** Are the "hits" in cohort A over-represented in the "hits" in cohort B, beyond what's expected by chance?

**Hypergeometric parameters:**
- **M**: total universe size (all proteins measured in both cohorts)
- **N**: number of "successes" in the urn (proteins upregulated in cohort A)
- **n**: number of draws (proteins upregulated in cohort B)
- **k**: observed overlap (proteins upregulated in both)

**P(X ≥ k)** = probability of seeing ≥k overlap by chance.

```python
from scipy.stats import hypergeom

# Cohort A: DE results
up_A = set(de_A[(de_A.padj < 0.05) & (de_A.log2FC > 0.5)].protein)
# Cohort B: DE results
up_B = set(de_B[(de_B.padj < 0.05) & (de_B.log2FC > 0.5)].protein)

# Universe = proteins measured in BOTH cohorts (intersection of tested sets)
universe = set(de_A.protein) & set(de_B.protein)
M = len(universe)
N = len(up_A & universe)  # up in A, and in the shared universe
n = len(up_B & universe)  # up in B, and in the shared universe
k = len(up_A & up_B)      # overlap

p = hypergeom.sf(k - 1, M, N, n)  # P(X ≥ k), sf(k-1) = 1 - cdf(k-1)
print(f"Overlap: {k} / {n} (p={p:.3e})")
```

## Critical: the universe must be the measured proteins

**WRONG:** using the full human proteome (~20,000 genes) as M.

**RIGHT:** using only the proteins **measured in both cohorts** (the intersection of tested sets).

Why? If cohort A measures 1,000 proteins and cohort B measures 500 (different panels), you can't draw from the 19,500 unmeasured proteins. The hypergeometric denominator is the shared, testable space.

## Directional concordance

"Overlap" means **directionally concordant** (both up, or both down), not just significant in both:

```python
# Upregulated in both
up_both = (
    set(de_A[(de_A.padj < 0.05) & (de_A.log2FC > 0.5)].protein) &
    set(de_B[(de_B.padj < 0.05) & (de_B.log2FC > 0.5)].protein)
)

# Downregulated in both
down_both = (
    set(de_A[(de_A.padj < 0.05) & (de_A.log2FC < -0.5)].protein) &
    set(de_B[(de_B.padj < 0.05) & (de_B.log2FC < -0.5)].protein)
)

# Total concordant
concordant = up_both | down_both
# Discordant = sig in both but opposite directions
discordant = (
    (set(de_A[de_A.padj < 0.05].protein) & set(de_B[de_B.padj < 0.05].protein)) -
    concordant
)
```

Report concordant vs discordant separately. Discordance suggests batch effects or biological heterogeneity.

## Effect-size threshold alignment

If cohort A uses `log2FC > 0.5` and cohort B uses `log2FC > 1.0`, the "hit" definitions differ. **Align thresholds** before computing overlap:

```python
# Use same cutoff for both
threshold = 0.5
up_A = set(de_A[(de_A.padj < 0.05) & (de_A.log2FC > threshold)].protein)
up_B = set(de_B[(de_B.padj < 0.05) & (de_B.log2FC > threshold)].protein)
```

## Full example: cross-cohort replication

```python
# Cohort A: upregulated in sepsis vs healthy
up_A = set(de_cohortA[(de_cohortA.padj < 0.05) & (de_cohortA.log2FC > 0.5)].protein)
# Cohort B: same
up_B = set(de_cohortB[(de_cohortB.padj < 0.05) & (de_cohortB.log2FC > 0.5)].protein)

# Universe
universe = set(de_cohortA.protein) & set(de_cohortB.protein)
M = len(universe)
N = len(up_A & universe)
n = len(up_B & universe)
k = len(up_A & up_B)

p = hypergeom.sf(k - 1, M, N, n)
print(f"Replication: {k}/{n} proteins upregulated in both cohorts (p={p:.3e})")
```

## Pitfalls

- **Universe = full proteome** — inflates p (wrong denominator)
- **No directional concordance check** — conflating discordance with replication
- **Threshold mismatch** — cohort A log2FC>0.5, cohort B log2FC>1.0
- **Not intersecting the tested sets** — proteins only measured in one cohort counted in M
- **Ranking by p-value instead of overlap size** — a 2/3 overlap (67%) can be more interesting than 10/100 (10%) even if the latter has lower p

## Grounding

`report`: M (universe size), N (cohort A hits in universe), n (cohort B hits in universe), k (observed overlap), p-value, concordant vs discordant breakdown.
