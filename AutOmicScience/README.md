# AutOmicScience Package

This package is a Magenta3 migration of the AOSE omics harness content from `Minions-Land/AutOmicScience` `origin/main` at `57ae83b`, with the `UPDATING/` audit constraints applied.

Included:

- `brands/AutOmicScience/**` package-local brand override using the AOSE Nature-inspired TUI palette.
- `skills/omics-shared/**` pure Markdown shared playbook and method docs (the common foundation every modality skill builds on).
- `skills/single-cell/**` single-cell omics: parent router + `rna/` (scRNA-seq), `atac/` (scATAC-seq), `multiome/` (paired RNA+ATAC) subskills.
- `skills/spatial/**` spatial transcriptomics: QC, spatial statistics, domains, deconvolution, cell-cell communication, cellular neighborhood detection.
- `skills/bulk/**` bulk omics: parent router + `rna/` (bulk RNA-seq) and `epigenomics/` (ChIP-seq / bulk ATAC-seq) subskills.
- `skills/bioml/**` bioinformatics ML: parent router + `repro/`, `deep-models/`, `sequence-fm/`, `coding/`, `figure-check/` subskills.
- `skills/cancer-genomics/**` tabular cancer genomics: MAF/CNA parsing, variant classification, recurrence, TMB, pathway alteration, oncoplots.
- `skills/proteomics/**` plasma Olink & mass-spec proteomics: NPX QC/DE, MaxQuant parsing, phosphoproteomics, enrichment.
- `skills/cancer-dependency/**` DepMap/CCLE dependency analysis: CRISPR gene-effect, selective dependency, druggability, synthetic lethality.
- `skills/metabolomics/**` plasma metabolomics & lipidomics: metabolite/lipid DE, covariate-adjusted association, annotation, mediation.
- `skills/clinical-survival/**` survival analysis: Kaplan-Meier, log-rank, Cox proportional-hazards regression, PH checks.
- `skills/microbiome/**` 16S rRNA & metagenomic abundance: CLR transformation, alpha/beta diversity, differential abundance, taxon-phenotype association.
- `tools/omics-compute/python/aose_omics_runtime/**` as the Python implementation for the `omics_compute` tool.
- `tools/omics-compute/python/tests/**` implementation tests.
- `tools/omics-environment/pixi.toml` and `tools/omics-environment/pixi.lock` for pinned task environments.
- Declarative `omics_environment` / `omics_preflight` and executable `omics_compute` tool descriptors.

Excluded on purpose:

- `tools/omics-compute/python/aose_agent/**`, the legacy Python package called out as orphaned.
- Bio-MAS ghost commands that call removed `aose_agent` subcommands.
- `census_query` and `geo_fetch` tool exposure, because the audited source lacks the `aose_omics_runtime.data` implementation modules.
- Implementation modules for `joint_embed`, `spatial_neighbors`, and `rna_atac_link` removed by the latest AOSE update.

Selection:

- **Co-load `MagentaWithPantheonOS`.** 14 skills here declare `run_python` and 12 declare
  `observe_figure` in `requiredTools`; Magenta core has neither, and
  [`MagentaWithPantheonOS`](../MagentaWithPantheonOS/) supplies them:
  `magenta --harness-package AutOmicScience --harness-package MagentaWithPantheonOS`.
- `AutOmicScience` (bare) loads the brand, system prompt, all skills, and tools.
- The package declares **3 profiles** for selective loading — `single-cell`
  (single-cell / spatial / immune-repertoire), `bulk-genomics` (bulk RNA-seq &
  epigenomics, somatic & statistical genetics, CRISPR dependency), and `molecular`
  (proteomics, metabolomics, microbiome, phase-separation). `default_profiles = []`
  means the bare name loads every component. The cross-cutting `clinical-survival`
  and `bioml` skills are **dual-tagged into all three**; `omics-shared` is always
  loaded.

## Environment model

- **`task1–4` are the standard execution environments**, isolated per modality
  (`scrna`→`task1`, `spatial`→`task2`, `multiome`→`task3`, `scatac`→`task4`); `all` is their
  superset. A tool's `modality` argument **selects one of them** — it is not a claim about
  what the data is.
- **`omics_install_env` only materialises environments this package already declares.** It
  cannot add a package.
- **A method whose package is not in `task1–4`** (the `PARTIAL`/`REFERENCE` ones) gets its own
  environment, built **beside the analysis outputs** — not inside the installed package, whose
  manifest is a checksum-verified artifact the host may delete and re-fetch.

The operational how-to lives in
[`AOSE_nonStandard_env.md`](skills/omics-shared/AutOmicScience/assets/references/AOSE_nonStandard_env.md);
this section is only the contract.

## Reference package

AutOmicScience is the canonical example package for Magenta3: it is the only
package that ships tools, a system prompt, a brand, and a pinned Python/Pixi
runtime alongside skills. When you need a working template for a tool-backed
domain package, copy this layout.
