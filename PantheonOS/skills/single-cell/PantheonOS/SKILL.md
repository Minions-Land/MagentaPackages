# Core Single-Cell Analysis Skills

High-priority, actionable workflows for the most common single-cell analysis tasks.
For deeper background and alternative methods, see the supplementary
[SC Best Practices](../../sc-best-practices/PantheonOS/SKILL.md) reference.

## Available Skills

### Quality Control

Standard QC workflow: filtering low-quality cells, doublet detection,
normalization, and QC metric visualization.

**Skill file**: [quality_control.md](assets/references/quality_control.md)

**When to use**:
- Starting analysis of a new single-cell dataset
- Need to filter low-quality cells
- Assessing data quality metrics

### Cell Type Annotation

Marker-based and reference-based approaches for assigning cell type labels.

**Skill file**: [cell_type_annotation.md](assets/references/cell_type_annotation.md)

**When to use**:
- After clustering, need to assign cell type labels
- Using marker genes for annotation
- Using reference-based methods (CellTypist, scArches)

### Trajectory Inference

Pseudotime analysis and trajectory inference for cell differentiation,
lineage tracing, and RNA velocity.

**Skill file**: [trajectory_inference.md](assets/references/trajectory_inference.md)

**When to use**:
- Studying cell differentiation paths
- Neurogenesis or developmental trajectory analysis
- RNA velocity for directional dynamics
